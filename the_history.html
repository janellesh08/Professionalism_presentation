            <h2 id="aside">Professionalism in the workplace can look differently
                depending on who you ask, but the overall consensus is 
                to follow one simple rule "Dress to impress!" This rule,
                however, is also a little cloudy in it's meaning. There 
                are obvious things to avoid such as: showing too much skin,
                dirty or wrinkled clothing, obscene or vulgar language. All 
                important things to steer clear of. There is a bit of a gray area, though, 
                when it comes to certain things like hair color, hair styles, 
                piercings, jewelry, and tattoos.
